Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_draft` directory. Go ahead and edit it and run `jekyll build --drafts` on the local site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_drafts` directory and avoid adding the date syntax to the file name and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
