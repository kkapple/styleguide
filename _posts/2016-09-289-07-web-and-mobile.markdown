# Web & Mobile

Vimeo, though an inanimate online platform, feels like a friend. Through our UI copy, we infuse our site and apps with a warmth that other humans find welcoming and endearing. Our copy is clear, concise, and helpful — our words guide users effortlessly through flows and inspire a high level of trust in them. Our copy should feel friendly and smart; it’s witty, but never inaccessible. Jokes are well and good but never in a high-stakes or error-ridden situation.  

## Landing pages

H1s & H2s<br>
CTAs

## Dialogs & light boxes

Registration
<br>Confirmation message
<br>iOS
<br>Android


## Buttons

Vimeo uses sentence casing for most headlines, labels, and button text.

**Ex**:<br>
Good: [Watch now]; [Log in to Vimeo]; [Save and continue]<br>
Bad: [Watch Now]; [Log In To Vimeo]; [Save And Continue]

When building join/log in components, the copy should be one of the following variations, depending on context:

[Join Vimeo]
<br>[Log in]
<br>[Log in to Vimeo]

Primary: [Continue with Facebook]
<br>Secondary: [Join with email]
<br>Tertiary: Already have an account? Log in.

## Popovers
  * General - Each popover onsite should not only communicate that something is new, but should also relay the key benefit or benefits of that thing. A multi-step popover should be used to introduce multiple facets/benefits of a more complex feature.
  * Title - Keep it short n’ sweet, ideally 2-3 words that capture key benefit. (max. 25 characters)
  * Subtitle - Only include in a multi-step popover; use to get more granular and succinctly introduce a specific feature or aspect of a new feature. (max. 35 characters) 
  * Description - Briefly explain why this thing is good, and how to use it. (max. 120 characters)
  * CTA - The CTA may vary depending on the feature and action we’re hoping to incite. “Get started” is a good bet, or “Go to {profile}.” In a multi-step popover, “Next” may be appropriate, but the final step should direct the user to take a specific action. (Ideally 2 words; 3 words max.) 
  * Dismiss - Every popover should have a button, text link, or “x” that allows the user to close the popover; the copy should be “Dismiss” or “Skip.”

## Tables
While most copy on vimeo.com is sentence cased, labels within tables (like for stats, or On Demand promo codes) are title cased.

**Ex**:<br>
Name | Total | Uses | Applies to | Start / End Date

## Links & URLs
When adding standalone links or hyperlinking a section of text, link the verbial phrase rather than including the words “click here.”

**Ex**:<br>
Good: To learn more about stats, [visit our FAQ][random-link].  
Bad: To learn more about stats, [click here][random-link].

When including a link to the Vimeo website, write it as “vimeo.com.” Never capitalize the first letter of the URL, even if that means restructuring your sentence so that it never falls at the beginning of a sentence.

**Ex**:<br>
Good: We completely redesigned vimeo.com for mobile web.
<br>Bad: We completely redesigned Vimeo.com for mobile web!

## Alerts & banners
Vimeo’s products include a number of different alerts that provide our users with important and helpful information. Alert types include:

*Blue: marketing upsell messages*<br>
Ex: Get in-depth stats, advanced privacy options, and more with Vimeo PRO.

*Green: additional information that may be helpful to the user* <br>
Ex: Make sure you’re abiding by our compression guidelines to get the best playback quality possible.

*Yellow: warning messages*<br>
Ex: You’ve exceeded your weekly limit. [Upgrade now][random-link] to get more space.


## Error messages
Context is key when it comes to writing error messages. Provide users with as much information as possible about what went wrong, and how they can go about correcting the issue. In some cases, you may not be able to provide more information. Rather than relying on cutesy messaging, try to be as clear (and apologetic, when applicable) in these situations. Remember that most people who receive error messages are likely frustrated, and will not want to see jocular, or unnecessary verbiage.

**Ex:**<br>
*Good*: <br>
Invalid promo code<br>
Check that you’ve entered the correct code, then try again. If you’re still having trouble, contact us.

*Bad*: <br>
Promo code: denied<br>
Sorry, Charlie.

When writing error messages for mobile, please consult the designers for the correct layout. In most cases, you will follow this pattern:

Header:  Unable to save changes
<br>Body:      Check your internet connection and try again.
<br>CTAs:     [Cancel] [Try again]
