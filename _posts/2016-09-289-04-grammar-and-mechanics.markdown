# Grammar and Mechanics
The Vimeo Manual of Style is a mongrel. It blends what the Chicago Manual of Style recommends with AP Style Guide stuff and adds a dash of “house style” that is particular to Vimeo. Our in-house style takes precedence over Chicago and A.P.

Your friendly neighborhood Messaging team has tried to spell out answers to as many style questions as possible in this guide. But certainly, there are things we’ve missed, so if you don’t find an answer here, please refer to the [Chicago Manual of Style][chicago-manual] or, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, ASK SOMEONE. For spelling, hyphenation, and capitalization questions, use the handy and quite dandy [Merriam-Webster][merriam-webster] online dictionary. Got a grammar quandary? [Grammar Girl][grammar-girl] is actually very on top of her game. Comma conundrum? [This article][comma-mistakes] has the answer. For questions about trademarked products, companies, or services (so you know what needs to be capitalized), [check out this list][trademark-checklist].

###### ABBREVIATIONS

In general, we follow AP style. So do not use periods in common terms such as DSLR, CIA, DA, FAQ, FBI, GI, PBS, POW, RBI, SUV, NJ, NYC, or VIP.

But do use periods in: A.D. and B.C., U.N., U.S., U.K., and a.k.a.


###### ACADEMIC DEGREES  

These require punctuation: Ph.D., J.D., M.D.
Plurals for the above degrees require apostrophes: "Ph.D.'s and M.D.'s were sprinkled throughout the audience of filmmaking enthusiasts."


On first reference, use "Dr." before the name of someone who holds a doctorate, but do not use "doctor" (or any form thereof) on second reference unless the person is a medical doctor.


Do not use "Dr." before the names of those who hold honorary degrees. Duh!


Spell out bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, doctor’s degree, and doctorate.

###### ACRONYMS
Use acronyms only if they are commonly understood. Spell out the name on first reference, followed by the acronym in parentheses. "The topic of focusing is inherently tied to that of depth of field (DOF)…”

Certain well-known acronyms can be used on first reference without being spelled out: DSLR, WTF, etc.

###### ADDRESSES
Use the abbreviations Ave., Blvd., Dr., Ct., Ln., Rd., St. when the address includes a street number: "555 W. 18th St."


But spell out those words where there is no street number: "We shot this killer footage over near Second Avenue."


If you refer to two or more streets at the same time, capitalize the name but lowercase the word "street": "Our gorgeous office is near the intersection of 18th and West streets."

###### AMPERSANDS
Ampersands should not be used to replace the word "and" unless it is part of the name of a title, group, or company. "Jibber & Jabber is one of the short films that moved us most this year.”

###### APOSTROPHES
Use apostrophes to indicate possession (“Ian’s desk” or “the Ians’ desks”) and contraction (“Ian’s here!”) of words. See Chicago Manual entry on "possessives" for detailed info.

###### CAPTIONS
The photo credit should be at the end of the caption, in parentheses. See Photo Credits, below, for style.

###### CENTURIES
Always use numbers and don't capitalize the "c" in century. If the phrase precedes a noun, use a hyphen: "20th-century cinema." When the date is used as a noun, don't: "Films from the early 20th century." Use a hyphen with "mid": Directors from the mid-20th century.

###### CITIES, COUNTRIES, LOCATORS
Follow AP style as to which cities require a state or country on first reference. If the usage or context makes the state or country clear, any city can stand alone: "A leading New York high school filmmaker, Smith left Poughkeepsie in 2003." The fact that Poughkeepsie is in NY is understood.

Certain large or well-known cities also generally stand alone: Los Angeles, New Orleans, Chicago, Boston, etc.

Spell out the full names of countries: Australia, Japan, Sri Lanka, etc., unless referring to the U.S. or U.K., which can be abbreviated on first reference.

Locator information in photo captions should be set off with parentheses: "Director Sam Morrill (left), executive producer Katie “Cray-T” Armstrong (center), and best boy Larry Adams (right) all contributed to the creative development of the Vimeo Original ‘Just Shoot Me: Feeling Comfortable On Camera.’ "

###### CLASS NAMES
If the name is generic (yoga class, guitar class), then no capitalization. If it refers to a specific class, then capitalize: French 101. If it is a unique title, then capitalize and put in quotation marks: "Real Estate Investing in a Down Market."

###### CO-
The prefix does not require a hyphen (cofounder) unless it precedes a word that begins with “o” (co-op, co-owner) or forms a word that would be confusing without the hyphen. (co-attempt is better than coattempt, because the latter looks like “coat tempt”)

###### COLLECTIVE NOUNS
In general, follow AP style. "The video review committee meets tonight. It is composed of..."

*Team and band names*  
Verbs should agree with team or band names: "The Yankees are playing..." "The Beatles are playing..." But, "Arcade Fire is playing..." "Radiohead is playing..."

*Company names*
A company is a singular entity, and thus takes the relevant verbs. “Vimeo is growing exponentially — it posted record profits this year” NOT “Vimeo is growing exponentially — they posted record profits this year.”

###### COLON
Use lowercase after a colon, regardless of whether or not a complete sentence follows. E.g., “Friday: a short film fest; Saturday: George Lucas competes in an arm-wrestling match with Steven Spielberg.” And “It’s hard to choose a favorite film: yes, *Casablanca* is great, but *Titanic* is *Titanic*.”

###### COMMA
For general rules, follow Chicago style. There are lots of rules. Please abide by them.

*Serial comma*<br>
In general, we do use serial commas, a.k.a. Oxford commas, which are placed before the word "and" or "or" in a series. So it's "Sox, Blake, and Chris went to the movies." Not "Sox, Blake and Chris went to the movies."


If the set of phrases is particularly complex and/or uses commas within each listed item, you might choose to set each item off with semicolons: "The hurricane caused residents to be evacuated from beachfront communities; a devastating storm surge, especially downtown; and the cancellation of the city's annual Halloween parade."

###### DASHES
We use em dashes (—) to set off an explanatory or amplifying statement. Use spaces before and after an em dash.
Example: "The film’s actors — all amateurs recruited in the local community — convey an authenticity rare in post-verité cinema."

You also can use a single em dash to create a rhythmic break in your sentence and put the focus on what comes after the em dash.

Marketing example: “We want creators to make more than movies — we want them to make money.”

Hyphens (-) are used in compound words and names, and to show a range of numbers. Example: "Pre-war cinema"; "Filmmakers age 18-108 are welcome to submit their work."

###### DATES
Spell out all month names.

Do not put a comma between the month and the year, e.g., "January 2008." But if the month is combined with a specific date and a year, set off the year with commas. E.g., "On May 18, 2006, an intrepid group of filmmakers founded a company called Vimeo."
Do not use ordinals with numerical dates. So it’s October 2, 2012, NOT October 2nd, 2012.

For a sequence of years, drop the first two numerals of the latter year and join the two with a hyphen. E.g., 1860-65 or 1956-74. But if the years span a century or millennium, use both full years, e.g., 1998-2012.

For a sequence of dates, use a hyphen with no spaces between the characters: "The film runs Thursday-Sunday." "Registration is open Sept. 20-24."

*Possessive dates*<br>
Use an apostrophe if the year is possessive: "2012's most interesting person was most certainly Barry Diller."

*Dates in the future*<br>
If the date is in the current calendar year, use "in" and not "this." E.g., "Michael Mann’s new film opens in November" and NOT "Michael Mann’s new film opens this November." If the event is in the next calendar year, use the year instead of "next": "The movie will open in November 2010" NOT "The movie will open next November."

*Decades*<br>
When referring to decades, no apostrophe is needed: E.g., 1820s, not 1820's. But if the first two numerals of the year are dropped, replace them with an apostrophe: "The '80s were the best decade of my life" NOT “The 80’s were the best decade of my life.”

If you are referring to decades of history, use numerals: "the '90s." But if you are referring to ages, spell the word out: "Grandma is in her eighties."

*Years*<br>
An abbreviated year needs an apostrophe unless it is used in a span with a full year: "Ian Durkin was born in '96" but "We held the NYC beer pong championship from 2008-12."


###### E.G. and I.E.
E.g. stands for the Latin exempli gratia, or "for example." Example: “Keanu Reeves starred in some of the best films of the ‘90s, e.g., *Point Break* and *Speed*.”


I.e. stands for the Latin id est, or "that is." It is typically followed by an explanation or elaboration of the point that precedes it. Example: “*Point Break’s* insanely hot protagonists (i.e., Keanu Reeves and Val Kilmer) also turn out to be insanely intelligent.”

E.g. and I.e. are followed by commas.

Please note that the two terms are NOT interchangeable.

###### ELLIPSES
Use an ellipsis (…) to show that you have deleted one or more words when condensing quotes and texts. Be careful to avoid deletions that may distort the meaning of the quote or text. “The New York Times called our film … tolerable … and Time Out New York pronounced it … watchable.”

An ellipsis also may be used to indicate a thought that the speaker or writer does not complete. "I would have put my pants back on, but..." Substitute a dash for this purpose if you are also using ellipses to indicate that words actually spoken or written have been deleted or condensed.

Please see the Chicago Manual of Style for full list of examples.

To type an ellipsis, please follow AP Style: three periods with a space both before and after.

###### ETHNIC PREFERENCE
Do not mention ethnic identity unless it is relevant to what you are writing about. When interviewing a person or reporting on an event, always ask someone for his/her preferred ethnic identity.

*African-American, black*<br>
Either term is appropriate provided someone does not express a preference.

*Native American/American Indian*<br>
The two terms have the same meaning. Follow the individual’s preference, or use the specific national affiliation, such as Cherokee or Seminole.

*Asian, Asian-American*<br>
Asian refers to anyone from Asia; Asian-American refers specifically to those of Asian ancestry who are permanent U.S. residents or American citizens.

*Hispanic, Latino/Latina/Chicano/Chicana*<br>
Recent polls show that a majority of those whose ethnic origin is in a Spanish-speaking country prefer to be called Hispanic rather than Latino/a. But there is a strong sentiment among some that "Hispanic" is a reminder of Spain's not-always-enlightened colonial domination of Latin America. In general, either term is appropriate, but ask individuals if they have a preference. Chicano/a is sometimes used in a derogatory manner, but has also been embraced by some Hispanic/Latino activists. Do not use unless it is the individual’s preference. Most Hispanics/ Latinos say they’d rather be identified by a country-specific designation (Puerto Rican; Mexican-American; Salvadoran).

*Mexican, Mexican-American* <br>
Mexican refers to someone born in Mexico; Mexican-American to someone who is a permanent resident or citizen of the U.S.
When combining another nationality with American, use a hyphen: German-American, African- American, Mexican-American. But no hyphen for Native American, Latin American, North American, South American.


###### EXCLAMATION POINTS
Please use sparingly unless part of quoted speech. Because we are an excitable bunch, there is a tendency to overuse exclamation points at Vimeo, so try to keep your written enthusiasm in check. Remember that the more you use exclamation points, the less effective any of those individual exclamation points will be.

###### FOREIGN WORDS OR TERMS
If a foreign word or phrase is not commonly used in English, put the first usage in italics. If you feel a significant number of readers will not understand the word, provide a translation: "The dancer was wearing a *huipile* — a bright-colored, woven top — with plain black tights."

If the word is foreign but commonplace in English usage — "et cetera," "doppelganger," "enfant terrible" — it does not need to be italicized.

Proper nouns in foreign languages do not need to be italicized. Example: "Have you seen this sweet vid about Christo and Jean-Claude wrapping the Reichstag?"

Foreign book/movie/music/artwork titles are set in italics, followed by a parenthetical translation that is NOT italicized. Example: "Carlos Reygadas' *Stellet Licht* (Silent Light) is one of my favorite movies."

###### FOREIGN NAMES
There is wide variation in the spelling and capitalization of European and American names that include particles such as "van," "de," or "von." Particles in European names are generally set in lowercase, so do not capitalize the particle if it is preceded by a first name or title: "Willem de Kooning," "Mr. de Kooning." However, you should capitalize "De Kooning" if there is no first name or title used, or if it’s the first word in a sentence.

In American and English names, capitals are typically used for the particle: "Martin Van Buren."

Given all the possible variations and preferences, always check!

*Some unusual cases that you may or may not run into*<br>
Osama bin Laden: "bin Laden" on second reference, but "Bin Laden" if it is the first word of a sentence.
Robert De Niro: "De Niro" on second reference
Marquis de Sade: "Sade" on second reference

*Asian names*<br>
Asian names are listed with the surname first: "Park Chan-wook has directed several highly acclaimed films."

The hyphenated given name (Chan-wook) is listed with a capitalized first word, lowercased second.

Subsequent references use the surname: "Park later worked with a new crop of actors on..."

Some Asian names have been Westernized, so always ask for the proper usage.


###### HISTORICAL/CULTURAL TERMS
When writing about art and film, you may need to reference historical and cultural terms, including the names of movements and styles. There is a wide variety of accepted usage in this category in terms of which words should be capitalized and (if based on a foreign word) italicized. Our policy is as follows: Words derived from proper nouns are capitalized. Others are lowercased, though exceptions are made to make a distinction from generic terms used in everyday speech (e.g., cynic vs. Cynic).

*Here is a quick guide:*<br>
<br>abstract impressionism
<br>art deco
<br>art nouveau
<br>Belle Époque
<br>baroque
<br>camp, campy
<br>Chicago school

the Industrial Revolution
<br>Prohibition
<br>Reconstruction
<br>September 11, Sept. 11, 9/11
<br>Baby Boom
<br>Civil Rights movement
<br>Cold War
<br>Gold Rush

*Time periods*<br>
Names of time periods, if descriptive, are lowercased, except for proper names. Some names, however, are capitalized by tradition or to avoid ambiguity. Names for modern periods are best left lowercased.

ancient Greece
<br>antebellum period
<br>the baroque period
<br>the colonial period
<br>the Victoria era; Victorian

but

the Nuclear Age
<br>the Information Age
<br>the Age of Reason
<br>the Common Era
<br> the Dark Ages
<br> the Enlightenment
<br> the Jazz Age
<br> the Middle Ages
<br> the Progressive Era
<br> the Renaissance
<br> the Roaring Twenties

###### HOLIDAYS
New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents Day (no apostrophe), Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day (abbreviated St. Paddy's Day, not St. Patty's Day), Mardi Gras, April Fool's Day ("Fool" is singular), Veterans Day (no apostrophe), July 4th or the Fourth of July or Independence Day, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Halloween, Thanksgiving Day, Election Day, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa.

###### HYPHENATION and COMPOUND ADJECTIVES
When a two-or-more-word phrase is used as an adjective to modify a noun (see what I did there?), use a hyphen: "After a second-quarter score, the Eagles led by 12." But no hyphen is needed when the compound phrase includes the adverb "very" or adverbs ending in "ly": "a very quick score," or "a rapidly evolving storm."
You also can use more than one hyphen to connect more than two words that modify a noun. E.g., "The paleontologists stumbled upon the bones of an as-yet-undiscovered dinosaur."

*Ages*<br>
Use hyphens for ages expressed as adjectives before a noun or as substitutes for a noun. Examples: “A 5-year-old boy lives down the street,” but “The boy down the street is 5 years old.”


“The boy, 7, has a sister, 10.”


“The woman, 26, has a daughter 2 months old.”

“The class is for 3-year-olds.” (Here the age is a substitute for a noun.)
“The woman is in her 30s.” (No apostrophe.)
Spell out “twentysomething,” “thirtysomething,” etc.

*Geography-based terms*<br>
No hyphen is needed unless the reference would be ambiguous without one. Example: “This Upper East Side dermatologist has earned rave reviews.”

###### LAWMAKERS
You probably won’t write about lawmakers. But in case you’re writing a long piece about a film on legislation, here you go:

*Members of Congress*<br>
 Use “Rep.” or “Sen.” before the last name and place the party affiliation and state in parentheses, using the state abbreviation: “Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY)”

*State lawmakers*<br>
Use “Rep.” and “Sen.” before the name, followed by party affiliation and town in parentheses: “Rep. Dae Mellencamp (R-South Orange)."

*Local lawmakers*<br>
Use “Councilwoman,” “Councilman,” or other appropriate title, plus the district in which they were elected: “Councilwoman Abby Morgan (R-1st District)”

###### LETTERS, PLURAL
When referring to the plural of a single letter of the alphabet, use an apostrophe: “Please mind your p’s and q’s.” "His report card contained only A's and B's."

###### MEASUREMENT
In body text, spell out measurements (“He ate a 12-ounce steak,” “The baby weighed 12 pounds”), but abbreviate in recipes ("Add 2 oz. chopped basil").

###### MEASUREMENT, DEGREES
Use the degree symbol when referring to temperature and use with “F” or “C” for Fahrenheit or Centigrade. Otherwise, spell it out: “Rotate the camera 360 degrees on its tripod.”

###### MID-
No hyphen (midcentury films) unless used with numbers (“mid-'60s”, “mid-20th century”) or proper nouns (“mid-Chicago”). Use a hyphen for readability/clarity.

###### MINI-
Do not use a hyphen (“We shopped at the minimall”), except when it precedes a proper noun, a word beginning with a vowel (“mini-onion,” “mini-arcade”), or if necessary for readability.

###### MONEY
Use only the dollar sign and numbers, without extra zeros: “$175” and not “$175.00.”

In quoted speech, use the dollar sign and numerals, even if the number is less than 10: “All the parts for this camera rig cost just $8,” NOT “All the parts for this camera rig cost just eight dollars.”


###### NAMES  
*Names of Businesses and Companies*<br>
In general, spell the name the way they do, even if that violates our normal rules for punctuation or abbreviation. On second reference, a company is an “it” and not a “they.” E.g., “Flickr has tools for both amateurs and professionals. It is one of the world’s largest photo-sharing platforms.”

Exception: Sports teams or bands with plural names take a plural verb or pronoun. E.g., “This week, the Cardinals try to extend their winning streak.”

*Names of People*<br>
Names of real or fictitious persons are capitalized. Spaces should never be used between initials preceding a surname (P.T. Barnum). Do not use a comma between a personal name and Jr. or Sr. or a numerical designation (Robert Downey Jr., Ian Bryce Durkin IV). Professional, civil, and religious titles are capitalized when they precede a personal name (President Barack Obama), but not when they are descriptive (French president Francois Hollande), and not when they follow the name (John Roberts, chief justice of the United States).

Use the first and last name (or middle and last name, if that is what the person prefers) on first reference, and only the last name thereafter. For children under the age of 15, use the first name on second reference. First names also may be used when two or more people have the same last name, e.g., family members. (“Ira and Philip are two of the more illustrious members of the Glass family.”) A husband and wife in the same story may be referred to as "Mr. Glass" and "Mrs. Glass" where applicable.

Fictional characters are generally referred to by their first names. “The film is centered around several quests undertaken by Luke Skywalker. In addition to rescuing his sister, the alluring Princess Leia, Luke wants to find out the true identity of his father.”

*Artists who use a stage name*<br>
When writing in an editorial capacity: Use the stage name when referring to the artist, but try to use his/her given name otherwise, particularly if the story does not directly relate to the performer's art: “Boy George, the flamboyant singer for the band Culture Club, plead guilty Tuesday to false reporting of a burglary. George, whose real name is George O’Dowd, appeared Tuesday morning in a Manhattan courtroom. O’Dowd was sentenced to three weeks of community service.”

*Band names*<br>
Within running text, the "the" preceding band names is lowercased: "This is the follow-up to the Strokes' debut album, Is This It."

Brand names and trademarks
Brand names that are registered trademarks (often indicated as such in the dictionary) should be capitalized if used. A full list of registered trademarks can be found at http://applications.inta.org/apps/trademark_checklist/

*Place names*<br>
Geographical destinations including compass directions are capitalized if they are commonly recognized areas: South; Southwest; Midwest; Pacific Northwest (in North America); Middle East; Southeast Asia; Central America; Southern California; East Coast; West Coast; Far East.

But compass directions are not capitalized if the direction or location is meant: "Head south until the road forks." "We're going north for the weekend."


*Recognized place names are capitalized*<br>
Back Bay
<br>the Fertile Crescent
<br>the Holy City
<br>the Old World
<br>the Panhandle
<br>the Promised Land
<br>Silicon Valley
<br>the Twin Cities
<br>the Upper West Side
<br>the Windy City
<br>Third World
<br>West Coast
<br>but
<br>iron curtain

In running text, spell out city and state names. State/country names are not necessary for well-known cities: Los Angeles, Chicago, London. Use the two-letter postal abbreviations for states: NJ, PA, CA

*Religious names and terms*<br>
Names of deities are capitalized, as are names of religions, denominations, churches and sects. Titles of religious texts (and divisions of the Bible) are capitalized and set in roman: Bible, Old Testament, Corinthians, Talmud, Koran.

*Ship and aircraft names*<br>
The names of specific ships, aircraft, and spacecraft are italicized, but designations such as SS or HMS are not. E.g., the Spirit of Saint Louis, Apollo 13, HMS Frolic, SS Carolina

###### NICKNAMES
On first reference, nicknames go in quotation marks. The quotation marks are dropped on second reference.

Use if everyone uses them, but pay attention to the context. In a blog post, they may be great. So “Wolfman shot hundreds of hours of footage” may be fine if a local character is known that way. But “Longtime Maplewood resident Charles 'Wolfman' Taylor, known for his detailed video journals of daily life in suburban NJ, died of a heart attack Wednesday.”

Nicknames can be fun, but they also can be too cute and overdone. Use your editorial judgment.

###### NUMBERS
Spell out numbers from one to nine. Use numerals for all numbers 10 and above. Exceptions are noted below.


Don’t begin a sentence with a number. Either spell out the number or recast the sentence.


Do not spell out numbers when referring to ages, technical specifications, page numbers, and sums of money (where you’re using a dollar sign):

“He has a son, 8, and a daughter, 3.” “The computer has 2 gigabytes of RAM.” “I have only $3 in my wallet.”

*Approximations*<br>
Spell out numbers when they are not exact: “Thousands of people are expected to attend the Vimeo Festival + Awards; hundreds may have films they’re hoping to sell.”

*Decades*<br>
(See DATES, above)

*Fractions*<br>
Spell out fractions less than one: “one fourth,” “six eighths.” Use hyphens when they are adjectives preceding a noun: “The Tip Jar project is three-fourths complete.” But no hyphen if the fraction stands alone: “I ate one fourth of the cake that Justin brought in.”

*Ordinals*<br>
Below 10, spell them out (First Amendment, second base) when they indicate a sequence or location. Exceptions generally are for military or political usages: 7th Fleet, 1st Ward. Do not use ordinals with dates.

*Page numbers*<br>
Always spell out “page” and use figures, even if below 10: “page 5, page 123.”

*Percentages*<br>
In text, always use numerals, even for 1-9, and spell out the word “percent.” In headlines or charts, “%” is appropriate. If the number is less than 1, add a zero in front: “0.9 percent of Vimeans think a Channel devoted to cat videos is a good idea.”

*Prices*<br>
Write out “million,” “billion,” and larger numbers: “$5 million,” not “$5,000,000.” Round off to a single decimal point: “$3,546,789” becomes “$3.5 million.” Prices should be preceded by a dollar sign, even within a range: “$20-$40.” Use the ¢ sign for cents: 25¢

*Telephone numbers*<br>
Always include the area code, and separate it from the number with a hyphen: 845-123-1234. Do not include a “1” before the area code.
