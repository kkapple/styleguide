# Grammar and Mechanics
The Vimeo Manual of Style is a mongrel. It blends what the Chicago Manual of Style recommends with AP Style Guide stuff and adds a dash of “house style” that is particular to Vimeo. Our in-house style takes precedence over Chicago and A.P.

Your friendly neighborhood Messaging team has tried to spell out answers to as many style questions as possible in this guide. But certainly, there are things we’ve missed, so if you don’t find an answer here, please refer to the [Chicago Manual of Style][chicago-manual] or, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, ASK SOMEONE. For spelling, hyphenation, and capitalization questions, use the handy and quite dandy [Merriam-Webster][merriam-webster] online dictionary. Got a grammar quandary? [Grammar Girl][grammar-girl] is actually very on top of her game. Comma conundrum? [This article][comma-mistakes] has the answer. For questions about trademarked products, companies, or services (so you know what needs to be capitalized), [check out this list][trademark-checklist].
