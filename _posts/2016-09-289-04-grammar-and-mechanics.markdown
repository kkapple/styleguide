# Grammar & Usage
The Vimeo Manual of Style is a mongrel. It blends what the Chicago Manual of Style recommends with AP Style Guide stuff and adds a dash of “house style” that is particular to Vimeo. Our in-house style takes precedence over Chicago and A.P.

Your friendly neighborhood Messaging team has tried to spell out answers to as many style questions as possible in this guide. But certainly, there are things we’ve missed, so if you don’t find an answer here, please refer to the [Chicago Manual of Style][chicago-manual] or, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, ASK SOMEONE. For spelling, hyphenation, and capitalization questions, use the handy and quite dandy [Merriam-Webster][merriam-webster] online dictionary. Got a grammar quandary? [Grammar Girl][grammar-girl] is actually very on top of her game. Comma conundrum? [This article][comma-mistakes] has the answer. For questions about trademarked products, companies, or services (so you know what needs to be capitalized), [check out this list][trademark-checklist].

###### ABBREVIATIONS

In general, we follow AP style. So do not use periods in common terms such as DSLR, CIA, DA, FAQ, FBI, GI, PBS, POW, RBI, SUV, NJ, NYC, or VIP.

But do use periods in: A.D. and B.C., U.N., U.S., U.K., and a.k.a.


###### ACADEMIC DEGREES  

These require punctuation: Ph.D., J.D., M.D.
Plurals for the above degrees require apostrophes: "Ph.D.'s and M.D.'s were sprinkled throughout the audience of filmmaking enthusiasts."


On first reference, use "Dr." before the name of someone who holds a doctorate, but do not use "doctor" (or any form thereof) on second reference unless the person is a medical doctor.


Do not use "Dr." before the names of those who hold honorary degrees. Duh!


Spell out bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, doctor’s degree, and doctorate.

###### ACRONYMS
Use acronyms only if they are commonly understood. Spell out the name on first reference, followed by the acronym in parentheses. "The topic of focusing is inherently tied to that of depth of field (DOF)…”

Certain well-known acronyms can be used on first reference without being spelled out: DSLR, WTF, etc.

###### ADDRESSES
Use the abbreviations Ave., Blvd., Dr., Ct., Ln., Rd., St. when the address includes a street number: "555 W. 18th St."


But spell out those words where there is no street number: "We shot this killer footage over near Second Avenue."


If you refer to two or more streets at the same time, capitalize the name but lowercase the word "street": "Our gorgeous office is near the intersection of 18th and West streets."

###### AMPERSANDS
Ampersands should not be used to replace the word "and" unless it is part of the name of a title, group, or company. "Jibber & Jabber is one of the short films that moved us most this year.”

###### APOSTROPHES
Use apostrophes to indicate possession (“Ian’s desk” or “the Ians’ desks”) and contraction (“Ian’s here!”) of words. See Chicago Manual entry on "possessives" for detailed info.

###### CAPTIONS
The photo credit should be at the end of the caption, in parentheses. See Photo Credits, below, for style.

###### CENTURIES
Always use numbers and don't capitalize the "c" in century. If the phrase precedes a noun, use a hyphen: "20th-century cinema." When the date is used as a noun, don't: "Films from the early 20th century." Use a hyphen with "mid": Directors from the mid-20th century.

###### CITIES, COUNTRIES, LOCATORS
Follow AP style as to which cities require a state or country on first reference. If the usage or context makes the state or country clear, any city can stand alone: "A leading New York high school filmmaker, Smith left Poughkeepsie in 2003." The fact that Poughkeepsie is in NY is understood.

Certain large or well-known cities also generally stand alone: Los Angeles, New Orleans, Chicago, Boston, etc.

Spell out the full names of countries: Australia, Japan, Sri Lanka, etc., unless referring to the U.S. or U.K., which can be abbreviated on first reference.

Locator information in photo captions should be set off with parentheses: "Director Sam Morrill (left), executive producer Katie “Cray-T” Armstrong (center), and best boy Larry Adams (right) all contributed to the creative development of the Vimeo Original ‘Just Shoot Me: Feeling Comfortable On Camera.’ "

###### CLASS NAMES
If the name is generic (yoga class, guitar class), then no capitalization. If it refers to a specific class, then capitalize: French 101. If it is a unique title, then capitalize and put in quotation marks: "Real Estate Investing in a Down Market."

###### CO-
The prefix does not require a hyphen (cofounder) unless it precedes a word that begins with “o” (co-op, co-owner) or forms a word that would be confusing without the hyphen. (co-attempt is better than coattempt, because the latter looks like “coat tempt”)

###### COLLECTIVE NOUNS
In general, follow AP style. "The video review committee meets tonight. It is composed of..."

*Team and band names*  
Verbs should agree with team or band names: "The Yankees are playing..." "The Beatles are playing..." But, "Arcade Fire is playing..." "Radiohead is playing..."

*Company names*
A company is a singular entity, and thus takes the relevant verbs. “Vimeo is growing exponentially — it posted record profits this year” NOT “Vimeo is growing exponentially — they posted record profits this year.”

###### COLON
Use lowercase after a colon, regardless of whether or not a complete sentence follows. E.g., “Friday: a short film fest; Saturday: George Lucas competes in an arm-wrestling match with Steven Spielberg.” And “It’s hard to choose a favorite film: yes, *Casablanca* is great, but *Titanic* is *Titanic*.”

###### COMMA
For general rules, follow Chicago style. There are lots of rules. Please abide by them.

*Serial comma*<br>
In general, we do use serial commas, a.k.a. Oxford commas, which are placed before the word "and" or "or" in a series. So it's "Sox, Blake, and Chris went to the movies." Not "Sox, Blake and Chris went to the movies."


If the set of phrases is particularly complex and/or uses commas within each listed item, you might choose to set each item off with semicolons: "The hurricane caused residents to be evacuated from beachfront communities; a devastating storm surge, especially downtown; and the cancellation of the city's annual Halloween parade."

###### DASHES
We use em dashes (—) to set off an explanatory or amplifying statement. Use spaces before and after an em dash.
Example: "The film’s actors — all amateurs recruited in the local community — convey an authenticity rare in post-verité cinema."

You also can use a single em dash to create a rhythmic break in your sentence and put the focus on what comes after the em dash.

Marketing example: “We want creators to make more than movies — we want them to make money.”

Hyphens (-) are used in compound words and names, and to show a range of numbers. Example: "Pre-war cinema"; "Filmmakers age 18-108 are welcome to submit their work."

###### DATES
Spell out all month names.

Do not put a comma between the month and the year, e.g., "January 2008." But if the month is combined with a specific date and a year, set off the year with commas. E.g., "On May 18, 2006, an intrepid group of filmmakers founded a company called Vimeo."
Do not use ordinals with numerical dates. So it’s October 2, 2012, NOT October 2nd, 2012.

For a sequence of years, drop the first two numerals of the latter year and join the two with a hyphen. E.g., 1860-65 or 1956-74. But if the years span a century or millennium, use both full years, e.g., 1998-2012.

For a sequence of dates, use a hyphen with no spaces between the characters: "The film runs Thursday-Sunday." "Registration is open Sept. 20-24."

*Possessive dates*<br>
Use an apostrophe if the year is possessive: "2012's most interesting person was most certainly Barry Diller."

*Dates in the future*<br>
If the date is in the current calendar year, use "in" and not "this." E.g., "Michael Mann’s new film opens in November" and NOT "Michael Mann’s new film opens this November." If the event is in the next calendar year, use the year instead of "next": "The movie will open in November 2010" NOT "The movie will open next November."

*Decades*<br>
When referring to decades, no apostrophe is needed: E.g., 1820s, not 1820's. But if the first two numerals of the year are dropped, replace them with an apostrophe: "The '80s were the best decade of my life" NOT “The 80’s were the best decade of my life.”

If you are referring to decades of history, use numerals: "the '90s." But if you are referring to ages, spell the word out: "Grandma is in her eighties."

*Years*<br>
An abbreviated year needs an apostrophe unless it is used in a span with a full year: "Ian Durkin was born in '96" but "We held the NYC beer pong championship from 2008-12."


###### E.G. and I.E.
E.g. stands for the Latin exempli gratia, or "for example." Example: “Keanu Reeves starred in some of the best films of the ‘90s, e.g., *Point Break* and *Speed*.”


I.e. stands for the Latin id est, or "that is." It is typically followed by an explanation or elaboration of the point that precedes it. Example: “*Point Break’s* insanely hot protagonists (i.e., Keanu Reeves and Val Kilmer) also turn out to be insanely intelligent.”

E.g. and I.e. are followed by commas.

Please note that the two terms are NOT interchangeable.

###### ELLIPSES
Use an ellipsis (…) to show that you have deleted one or more words when condensing quotes and texts. Be careful to avoid deletions that may distort the meaning of the quote or text. “The New York Times called our film … tolerable … and Time Out New York pronounced it … watchable.”

An ellipsis also may be used to indicate a thought that the speaker or writer does not complete. "I would have put my pants back on, but..." Substitute a dash for this purpose if you are also using ellipses to indicate that words actually spoken or written have been deleted or condensed.

Please see the Chicago Manual of Style for full list of examples.

To type an ellipsis, please follow AP Style: three periods with a space both before and after.

###### ETHNIC PREFERENCE
Do not mention ethnic identity unless it is relevant to what you are writing about. When interviewing a person or reporting on an event, always ask someone for his/her preferred ethnic identity.

*African-American, black*<br>
Either term is appropriate provided someone does not express a preference.

*Native American/American Indian*<br>
The two terms have the same meaning. Follow the individual’s preference, or use the specific national affiliation, such as Cherokee or Seminole.

*Asian, Asian-American*<br>
Asian refers to anyone from Asia; Asian-American refers specifically to those of Asian ancestry who are permanent U.S. residents or American citizens.

*Hispanic, Latino/Latina/Chicano/Chicana*<br>
Recent polls show that a majority of those whose ethnic origin is in a Spanish-speaking country prefer to be called Hispanic rather than Latino/a. But there is a strong sentiment among some that "Hispanic" is a reminder of Spain's not-always-enlightened colonial domination of Latin America. In general, either term is appropriate, but ask individuals if they have a preference. Chicano/a is sometimes used in a derogatory manner, but has also been embraced by some Hispanic/Latino activists. Do not use unless it is the individual’s preference. Most Hispanics/ Latinos say they’d rather be identified by a country-specific designation (Puerto Rican; Mexican-American; Salvadoran).

*Mexican, Mexican-American* <br>
Mexican refers to someone born in Mexico; Mexican-American to someone who is a permanent resident or citizen of the U.S.
When combining another nationality with American, use a hyphen: German-American, African- American, Mexican-American. But no hyphen for Native American, Latin American, North American, South American.


###### EXCLAMATION POINTS
Please use sparingly unless part of quoted speech. Because we are an excitable bunch, there is a tendency to overuse exclamation points at Vimeo, so try to keep your written enthusiasm in check. Remember that the more you use exclamation points, the less effective any of those individual exclamation points will be.

###### FOREIGN WORDS OR TERMS
If a foreign word or phrase is not commonly used in English, put the first usage in italics. If you feel a significant number of readers will not understand the word, provide a translation: "The dancer was wearing a *huipile* — a bright-colored, woven top — with plain black tights."

If the word is foreign but commonplace in English usage — "et cetera," "doppelganger," "enfant terrible" — it does not need to be italicized.

Proper nouns in foreign languages do not need to be italicized. Example: "Have you seen this sweet vid about Christo and Jean-Claude wrapping the Reichstag?"

Foreign book/movie/music/artwork titles are set in italics, followed by a parenthetical translation that is NOT italicized. Example: "Carlos Reygadas' *Stellet Licht* (Silent Light) is one of my favorite movies."

###### FOREIGN NAMES
There is wide variation in the spelling and capitalization of European and American names that include particles such as "van," "de," or "von." Particles in European names are generally set in lowercase, so do not capitalize the particle if it is preceded by a first name or title: "Willem de Kooning," "Mr. de Kooning." However, you should capitalize "De Kooning" if there is no first name or title used, or if it’s the first word in a sentence.

In American and English names, capitals are typically used for the particle: "Martin Van Buren."

Given all the possible variations and preferences, always check!

*Some unusual cases that you may or may not run into*<br>
Osama bin Laden: "bin Laden" on second reference, but "Bin Laden" if it is the first word of a sentence.
Robert De Niro: "De Niro" on second reference
Marquis de Sade: "Sade" on second reference

*Asian names*<br>
Asian names are listed with the surname first: "Park Chan-wook has directed several highly acclaimed films."

The hyphenated given name (Chan-wook) is listed with a capitalized first word, lowercased second.

Subsequent references use the surname: "Park later worked with a new crop of actors on..."

Some Asian names have been Westernized, so always ask for the proper usage.


###### HISTORICAL/CULTURAL TERMS
When writing about art and film, you may need to reference historical and cultural terms, including the names of movements and styles. There is a wide variety of accepted usage in this category in terms of which words should be capitalized and (if based on a foreign word) italicized. Our policy is as follows: Words derived from proper nouns are capitalized. Others are lowercased, though exceptions are made to make a distinction from generic terms used in everyday speech (e.g., cynic vs. Cynic).

*Here is a quick guide:*<br>
<br>abstract impressionism
<br>art deco
<br>art nouveau
<br>Belle Époque
<br>baroque
<br>camp, campy
<br>Chicago school

*Historical events*<br>
Names of major historical events and projects are capitalized. Others that are more recent or generic are usually lowercased. E.g.:

the Industrial Revolution
<br>Prohibition
<br>Reconstruction
<br>September 11, Sept. 11, 9/11
<br>Baby Boom
<br>Civil Rights movement
<br>Cold War
<br>Gold Rush

*Time periods*<br>
Names of time periods, if descriptive, are lowercased, except for proper names. Some names, however, are capitalized by tradition or to avoid ambiguity. Names for modern periods are best left lowercased.

ancient Greece
<br>antebellum period
<br>the baroque period
<br>the colonial period
<br>the Victoria era; Victorian

but

the Nuclear Age
<br>the Information Age
<br>the Age of Reason
<br>the Common Era
<br> the Dark Ages
<br> the Enlightenment
<br> the Jazz Age
<br> the Middle Ages
<br> the Progressive Era
<br> the Renaissance
<br> the Roaring Twenties

###### HOLIDAYS
New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents Day (no apostrophe), Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day (abbreviated St. Paddy's Day, not St. Patty's Day), Mardi Gras, April Fool's Day ("Fool" is singular), Veterans Day (no apostrophe), July 4th or the Fourth of July or Independence Day, Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, Halloween, Thanksgiving Day, Election Day, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa.

###### HYPHENATION and COMPOUND ADJECTIVES
When a two-or-more-word phrase is used as an adjective to modify a noun (see what I did there?), use a hyphen: "After a second-quarter score, the Eagles led by 12." But no hyphen is needed when the compound phrase includes the adverb "very" or adverbs ending in "ly": "a very quick score," or "a rapidly evolving storm."
You also can use more than one hyphen to connect more than two words that modify a noun. E.g., "The paleontologists stumbled upon the bones of an as-yet-undiscovered dinosaur."

*Ages*<br>
Use hyphens for ages expressed as adjectives before a noun or as substitutes for a noun. Examples: “A 5-year-old boy lives down the street,” but “The boy down the street is 5 years old.”


“The boy, 7, has a sister, 10.”


“The woman, 26, has a daughter 2 months old.”

“The class is for 3-year-olds.” (Here the age is a substitute for a noun.)
“The woman is in her 30s.” (No apostrophe.)
Spell out “twentysomething,” “thirtysomething,” etc.

*Geography-based terms*<br>
No hyphen is needed unless the reference would be ambiguous without one. Example: “This Upper East Side dermatologist has earned rave reviews.”

###### LAWMAKERS
You probably won’t write about lawmakers. But in case you’re writing a long piece about a film on legislation, here you go:

*Members of Congress*<br>
 Use “Rep.” or “Sen.” before the last name and place the party affiliation and state in parentheses, using the state abbreviation: “Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY)”

*State lawmakers*<br>
Use “Rep.” and “Sen.” before the name, followed by party affiliation and town in parentheses: “Rep. Dae Mellencamp (R-South Orange)."

*Local lawmakers*<br>
Use “Councilwoman,” “Councilman,” or other appropriate title, plus the district in which they were elected: “Councilwoman Abby Morgan (R-1st District)”

###### LETTERS, PLURAL
When referring to the plural of a single letter of the alphabet, use an apostrophe: “Please mind your p’s and q’s.” "His report card contained only A's and B's."

###### MEASUREMENT
In body text, spell out measurements (“He ate a 12-ounce steak,” “The baby weighed 12 pounds”), but abbreviate in recipes ("Add 2 oz. chopped basil").

###### MEASUREMENT, DEGREES
Use the degree symbol when referring to temperature and use with “F” or “C” for Fahrenheit or Centigrade. Otherwise, spell it out: “Rotate the camera 360 degrees on its tripod.”

###### MID-
No hyphen (midcentury films) unless used with numbers (“mid-'60s”, “mid-20th century”) or proper nouns (“mid-Chicago”). Use a hyphen for readability/clarity.

###### MINI-
Do not use a hyphen (“We shopped at the minimall”), except when it precedes a proper noun, a word beginning with a vowel (“mini-onion,” “mini-arcade”), or if necessary for readability.

###### MONEY
Use only the dollar sign and numbers, without extra zeros: “$175” and not “$175.00.”

In quoted speech, use the dollar sign and numerals, even if the number is less than 10: “All the parts for this camera rig cost just $8,” NOT “All the parts for this camera rig cost just eight dollars.”


###### NAMES  
*Names of Businesses and Companies*<br>
In general, spell the name the way they do, even if that violates our normal rules for punctuation or abbreviation. On second reference, a company is an “it” and not a “they.” E.g., “Flickr has tools for both amateurs and professionals. It is one of the world’s largest photo-sharing platforms.”

Exception: Sports teams or bands with plural names take a plural verb or pronoun. E.g., “This week, the Cardinals try to extend their winning streak.”

*Names of People*<br>
Names of real or fictitious persons are capitalized. Spaces should never be used between initials preceding a surname (P.T. Barnum). Do not use a comma between a personal name and Jr. or Sr. or a numerical designation (Robert Downey Jr., Ian Bryce Durkin IV). Professional, civil, and religious titles are capitalized when they precede a personal name (President Barack Obama), but not when they are descriptive (French president Francois Hollande), and not when they follow the name (John Roberts, chief justice of the United States).

Use the first and last name (or middle and last name, if that is what the person prefers) on first reference, and only the last name thereafter. For children under the age of 15, use the first name on second reference. First names also may be used when two or more people have the same last name, e.g., family members. (“Ira and Philip are two of the more illustrious members of the Glass family.”) A husband and wife in the same story may be referred to as "Mr. Glass" and "Mrs. Glass" where applicable.

Fictional characters are generally referred to by their first names. “The film is centered around several quests undertaken by Luke Skywalker. In addition to rescuing his sister, the alluring Princess Leia, Luke wants to find out the true identity of his father.”

*Artists who use a stage name*<br>
When writing in an editorial capacity: Use the stage name when referring to the artist, but try to use his/her given name otherwise, particularly if the story does not directly relate to the performer's art: “Boy George, the flamboyant singer for the band Culture Club, plead guilty Tuesday to false reporting of a burglary. George, whose real name is George O’Dowd, appeared Tuesday morning in a Manhattan courtroom. O’Dowd was sentenced to three weeks of community service.”

*Band names*<br>
Within running text, the "the" preceding band names is lowercased: "This is the follow-up to the Strokes' debut album, Is This It."

Brand names and trademarks
Brand names that are registered trademarks (often indicated as such in the dictionary) should be capitalized if used. A full list of registered trademarks can be found at http://applications.inta.org/apps/trademark_checklist/

*Place names*<br>
Geographical destinations including compass directions are capitalized if they are commonly recognized areas: South; Southwest; Midwest; Pacific Northwest (in North America); Middle East; Southeast Asia; Central America; Southern California; East Coast; West Coast; Far East.

But compass directions are not capitalized if the direction or location is meant: "Head south until the road forks." "We're going north for the weekend."


*Recognized place names are capitalized*<br>
Back Bay
<br>the Fertile Crescent
<br>the Holy City
<br>the Old World
<br>the Panhandle
<br>the Promised Land
<br>Silicon Valley
<br>the Twin Cities
<br>the Upper West Side
<br>the Windy City
<br>Third World
<br>West Coast
<br>but
<br>iron curtain

In running text, spell out city and state names. State/country names are not necessary for well-known cities: Los Angeles, Chicago, London. Use the two-letter postal abbreviations for states: NJ, PA, CA

*Religious names and terms*<br>
Names of deities are capitalized, as are names of religions, denominations, churches and sects. Titles of religious texts (and divisions of the Bible) are capitalized and set in roman: Bible, Old Testament, Corinthians, Talmud, Koran.

*Ship and aircraft names*<br>
The names of specific ships, aircraft, and spacecraft are italicized, but designations such as SS or HMS are not. E.g., the Spirit of Saint Louis, Apollo 13, HMS Frolic, SS Carolina

###### NICKNAMES
On first reference, nicknames go in quotation marks. The quotation marks are dropped on second reference.

Use if everyone uses them, but pay attention to the context. In a blog post, they may be great. So “Wolfman shot hundreds of hours of footage” may be fine if a local character is known that way. But “Longtime Maplewood resident Charles 'Wolfman' Taylor, known for his detailed video journals of daily life in suburban NJ, died of a heart attack Wednesday.”

Nicknames can be fun, but they also can be too cute and overdone. Use your editorial judgment.

###### NUMBERS
Spell out numbers from one to nine. Use numerals for all numbers 10 and above. Exceptions are noted below.


Don’t begin a sentence with a number. Either spell out the number or recast the sentence.


Do not spell out numbers when referring to ages, technical specifications, page numbers, and sums of money (where you’re using a dollar sign):

“He has a son, 8, and a daughter, 3.” “The computer has 2 gigabytes of RAM.” “I have only $3 in my wallet.”

*Approximations*<br>
Spell out numbers when they are not exact: “Thousands of people are expected to attend the Vimeo Festival + Awards; hundreds may have films they’re hoping to sell.”

*Decades*<br>
(See DATES, above)

*Fractions*<br>
Spell out fractions less than one: “one fourth,” “six eighths.” Use hyphens when they are adjectives preceding a noun: “The Tip Jar project is three-fourths complete.” But no hyphen if the fraction stands alone: “I ate one fourth of the cake that Justin brought in.”

*Ordinals*<br>
Below 10, spell them out (First Amendment, second base) when they indicate a sequence or location. Exceptions generally are for military or political usages: 7th Fleet, 1st Ward. Do not use ordinals with dates.

*Page numbers*<br>
Always spell out “page” and use figures, even if below 10: “page 5, page 123.”

*Percentages*<br>
In text, always use numerals, even for 1-9, and spell out the word “percent.” In headlines or charts, “%” is appropriate. If the number is less than 1, add a zero in front: “0.9 percent of Vimeans think a Channel devoted to cat videos is a good idea.”

*Prices*<br>
Write out “million,” “billion,” and larger numbers: “$5 million,” not “$5,000,000.” Round off to a single decimal point: “$3,546,789” becomes “$3.5 million.” Prices should be preceded by a dollar sign, even within a range: “$20-$40.” Use the ¢ sign for cents: 25¢

*Telephone numbers*<br>
Always include the area code, and separate it from the number with a hyphen: 845-123-1234. Do not include a “1” before the area code.

###### OVER vs. MORE THAN
Use “more than” for numbers: “She’s made more than 200 short films about sea life.” Use “over” for location: “The truck climbed the steep road over the mountains.”

###### PARENTHESES
Parentheses are used to enclose material that is less closely related to the rest of the sentence than that enclosed between em dashes or commas. Parentheses are used to add more information to a sentence, but the sentence will still be grammatically correct without the parenthetical statement.

There are lots of ways to use (and misuse) parentheses.

*Examples, directions, explanations, and clarifications*<br>
“Retain ampersands when they appear as part of an official name (Barnes & Noble, Ben & Jerry’s).”

“At that point, you may want to consult with a professional. (Refer to the blog post we did about camera repair.)”

“Here is a selective glossary of editing and production terms. (Synonyms are in italics; cross-referenced terms are in bold italics.)”

“Precede the dollar amount with the initials U.S. only to avoid confusion (in, say, an article about filmmaking in Australia, where the basic unit of currency is also called the dollar).”

*Numerals that confirm a spelled-out number in a contract*<br>
The confirmation letter is due within thirty (30) days.”

*Abbreviations (usually) after the first reference to the full version of the term*<br>
“The country’s import and export levels are regulated by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).”

Note: If the abbreviation is well known or is used again within the next sentence or two after the full name, omit the parenthesized abbreviation immediately after it.

*Numbers or letters that distinguish items in a run-in list*<br>
“The constituent parts are (1) the camera body, (2) the lens, and (3) the eyeball.”

Note: Sometimes, only the close parenthesis [1), 2), etc.] is used in this format. However, usually, neither numbers nor parentheses are necessary in such cases.

*Modifying words or phrases, or interjections*<br>
“The writer will (one hopes) produce well-crafted prose.”

“It turns out that Sam Morrill had (gasp!) told the truth.”

*Translations, pronunciations, or equivalents*<br>
“She ran from the kuma (bear).”

“We filmed at the warung (wah-ROONG) near the mosque.”

“The distance from Marseille to Paris is 771 kilometers (479 miles).”

*In-text citations*<br>
“However, the literature is ambivalent on this issue (Kael 1972; Ebert et al. 1989).”

###### Punctuation in Parentheses
A full sentence in parentheses is capitalized and is followed by a period preceding the closing parenthesis: “Have these resources on hand before you begin. (Items listed in parentheses are desirable but not essential.)”

A partial sentence in parentheses is not capitalized and is not followed by a period but may precede a question mark or exclamation point: “Use a dark, fine-pointed pen (erasable pens allow for neat alteration) or pencil.” “Now that you’re finished editing (you are finished, aren’t you?), it’s time for the finishing touches.”

*One last thing to remember*<br>
An occasional parenthetical aside can be helpful, but too many parentheses can bog down the text.

###### PLURALS
Please refer to the Chicago Manual for the full list of rules related to plurals.

###### POSSESSIVES
Please refer to the Chicago Manual for the full list of rules related to possessives. There are kind of a lot of rules.

FYI possessive words ending in S (plural possessives, most often) take only an apostrophe, not an 's. "The houses' roofs were torn off." "The dress' hem was mangled by the sewing machine."

###### PHOTO CREDITS
Photo credits should appear at the end of a photo caption: "Credit: [name of person]." E.g., "Vimeo Video School honcho Dan Hayek fields a question from an enthusiastic member of the crowd. Credit: Bill Bergen"

###### PREFIXES
In general, do not use a hyphen unless not doing so would lead to misunderstanding or create a word that is difficult to read. Exceptions: When the root is a proper noun or an adjective (“post-Iraq War”; “pre-war building”).

Generally do not hyphenate when using a prefix with a word starting with a consonant. (“Subcategory”) Three rules are constant:

1. Except for "cooperate" and "coordinate," use a hyphen if the prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. (“Mini-interruption”)
2. Use a hyphen if the word that follows is capitalized ("post-Iraq War").
3. Use a hyphen to join doubled prefixes. Example: "sub-subparagraph."

###### Q&A FORMAT
When doing an interview or Q&A, precede it with an introduction or note set in italics to identify the interviewee and interviewer. For the first question and answer, use the interviewee’s full name set in bold, but afterward use only last names, also in bold. Do not use quotation marks around the quotes.

**Vimeo**: So what’s the new film about?

**David Lynch**: It’s like a children’s movie about rabbits, but for adults. With spooky music.

###### QUOTATION MARKS
Double quotation marks ("...") are used to enclose quoted material, song titles, chapter titles and article titles. Example: Behold the new video for Japandroids’ song “The House That Heaven Built.”

Single quotes ('...') are only used within double quotes. ("She once said to me, 'I don't like Casey Neistat,' " Whitman told the crowd.)

###### SAINT, SAINTS
In general, abbreviate when used in a place name or street name (St. Augustine, FL; St. Marks Place), but spell out when used as the name of a saint (Saint Francis). Exception: St. Patrick’s Day.

###### SEMICOLONS
Use semicolons to indicate a greater separation of thought and information than a comma can convey, but less than the separation implied by a period.

To clarify a series: Use semicolons to separate elements of a series when the items in the series are long or when individual segments contain material that also must be set off by commas: "The Vimeo spirit team is composed of Andrea Allen, of Missouri; three Connecticut dudes, Ian Durkin, Ian Durkin, and Matt Schwarz; and a cool bro, Darnell, from California."

Note that like the serial comma, the semicolon is used before the final "and" in such a sequence.

To link independent clauses: Use a semicolon when a coordinating conjunction such as "and," "but," or "for" is not present: "The Weekend Project submissions were due last week; hers arrived today."

If a coordinating conjunction is present, use a semicolon before it only if extensive punctuation also is required in one or more of the individual clauses: "They pulled their boats from the water, sandbagged the retaining walls, and boarded up the windows; but even with these precautions, the island's residents were hard-hit by the hurricane."

Unless a particular literary effect is desired, however, the better approach is to break independent clauses into separate sentences.

###### SEXUAL ORIENTATION
Do not mention unless it is relevant to the story.

*Gay/lesbian*<br>
Use gay as a synonym for homosexual, primarily for males. Lesbian is the preferred term for women, and “gays and lesbians” for homosexual men and women. In headlines, where space is an issue, “gays” is acceptable for both. In general, use “gay” as an adjective (“gay man,” “gay people”) but not as a noun unless it refers to a community and not an individual: “Most gays are opposed to the measure,” NOT “two gays standing nearby disagreed.”

*Gay lifestyle*<br>
Do not use. There is no such thing.

*Gay relationships*<br>
If the commitment is relevant to what you’re writing about, ask the individual what he or she prefers. Otherwise, use “partner.”

*Homosexual*<br>
This is a medical term. “Gay” or “lesbian” is the preferred expression.

###### SIZE
Use a hyphen ("full-size screen"). You don’t need a “d” if you’re comparing size (marble-size), but use the “d” when referring to something scaled (or “sized”) for a certain space: “an apartment-sized refrigerator.”

###### SLANG
We want our copy to have an informal, conversational tone, so slang may sometimes be appropriate. However, don't go out of your way to use it, and don’t let slang confuse the reader. We want to let everyone know we’re cool enough to know the lingo, but we don’t want to leave out any of our readers, especially the many from outside the U.S. If you use a slang expression that's important to your topic, but which you reckon many readers won’t understand, add a parenthetical explanation.


###### STATES/COMMONWEALTHS
If a state name is part of a place name or someone’s title, spell out the name. E.g., New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

Spell out the names of the 50 United States when they stand alone in text.


Use U.S. Postal Service codes (with no periods) for state abbreviations:

| AL | DE | IA | MI | NC | OK | TX | WY |
| AK | FL | KS | MN | NV | OR | UT | DC |
| AZ | GA | KY | MS | NH | PA | VA | PR |
| AR | HI | LA | MO | NJ | RI | VT | VI |
| CA | ID | ME | MT | NM | SC | WA |    |
| CO | IL | MD | ND | NY | SD | WV |    |
| CT | IN | MA | NE | OH | TN | WI |    |


###### SWEAR WORDS
We like to sound cool, but we also want to keep things PG-13 at Vimeo and on our blog, so please do some light censoring when writing or editing the words of others. Don’t write anything that you wouldn’t want to say in front of your medium-hip mom or cool aunt.

OK: Shit, goddamn, etc.<br>
Not OK: Fuck, etc.

How to “bleep” things out:<br>
"Fuck" becomes "F—"<br>
"Fucked" becomes "F—d"

###### TIME
Use lower case letters with periods for a.m. and p.m. If the time falls exactly on the hour, use the number and “a.m.,” “p.m.” or “o’clock.” E.g., “3 p.m.” or “3 o’clock.” Not “3:00 p.m.”

*Noon/midnight*<br>
Use noon and midnight in place of 12 a.m. or 12 p.m., which can be confusing to readers. Do NOT put a “12” in front of either one (12 noon).

###### TITLES OF COMPOSITIONS
In general, larger works should be set in italics; smaller portions are in quotation marks. A book title is italicized; a magazine article needs quotation marks. A CD or album name is italicized, an individual song gets quotation marks.

In general, use italics for the titles of books, plays, albums or CDs, video games, poems, movies, TV and web series, radio shows, and works of art.


Use quotation marks around the titles of videos unless you know the video is specifically intended by its creator as a work of art.

Example: The band Grizzly Bear asked Allison Schulnik to make a video for their song “Ready, Able” after seeing her video piece Mound.

Use quotation marks for songs, articles, speeches and research papers.

Exceptions!

Reference works such as encyclopedias and dictionaries do not need italics, nor does the Bible or the Koran.

*Newspapers, magazines*<br>
The names of periodicals should be italicized. Time, Newsweek, The New York Times. Include "the" only if it's part of the publications official name.

*Musical works*<br>
Do not use italics unless the work has a special title or nickname: Beethoven’s Symphony No. 1 in C Major, but: Beethoven’s Appassionata concerto.

Note: do not italicize the punctuation surrounding the italicized title. For example, if a comma immediately follows War and Peace, don’t italicize it.

###### TITLES OF PEOPLE
Capitalize a person’s title only if it is used immediately before the name: “Vimeo President Dae Mellencamp.” But “the company’s president, Dae Mellencamp, walked out of the meeting” and "Dae Mellencamp, Vimeo’s president, walked out of the meeting." Use lower case when a title is used alone: “the president”

*Judge, justice*<br>
It’s unlikely that you’ll be writing about this, but just in case: Members of the U.S. Supreme Court are “justices.” All other courts in the U.S. are presided over by judges, with the exception of magistrate’s courts, which are presided over by magistrates.

Exception: New York state refers to its lower-level trial courts as “supreme courts” because decisions there are made by the people, i.e., juries, so those courts are presided over by justices. The top New York court is the New York Court of Appeal, presided over by judges. The correct title for the head of the U.S. Supreme Court is Chief Justice of the United States, not Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

Spell out titles when they stand alone. Abbreviations are allowed when the title precedes a proper noun: “California governor,” but “former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.” Exception: DA is permissible standing alone, on second reference.
FYI the plural of “attorney general” is “attorneys general,” just like the plural of “passerby” is “passersby.” Ya dig?


###### WEB AND COMPUTER TERMS

dial up (verb)
<br>dial-up (adj.) e-mail
<br>homepage (always one word)
<br>Internet (always capitalized cuz it’s a proper noun)
<br>log in, log out (verb)
<br>login, logout (noun)
<br>multimedia (one word)
<br>Net (short for Internet)
<br>online, offline
<br>website (here we go against conventionally capitalized World Wide Web)
<br>web page
<br>webmaster, webzine, webcast

Frequently (ab)used web and computer acronyms (Use ALL CAPS):
FAQ — frequently asked question (plural FAQs)
<br>FTP — file transfer protocol
<br>GIF — an image format, from “graphic interchange format”
<br>GUI — graphical user interface (plural GUIs)
<br>HTML — hypertext markup language (the code used to create websites)
<br>IP — Internet protocol
<br>ISP — Internet service provider (e.g., Optimum Online, Comcast)
<br>JPEG or JPG — A type of image compression, from “joint photographic experts group”
<br>LAN — local area network
<br>TCP/IP — transmission control protocol/Internet protocol
<br>TIFF — an image display format, from “tagged image file format”
<br>URL — Uniform Resource Locator, aka website address
<br>Wi-Fi – trade name for a popular wireless technology

*Protocols*<br>
Do not use http:// in a Web site address within body copy, and always lowercase the first initial of the site name. But add the protocol if it is not http://, e.g., ftp:// or gopher:// or https://


Do not use “www” in a website address within body copy. "Visit our gorgeous homepage at vimeo.com."

*Website and company names*<br>
This can be trickier than it seems because the name of the company may be different from its web address. Look for the company’s logo on the homepage or perhaps in the About Us text (look for the link at the bottom of a page) to find the correct spelling and punctuation. If the name does not include the hierarchy (.com, .net, .edu, .gov), then do not include it in the name. But add the website address including the hierarchy in parentheses immediately after the name on first reference.

If the site is referred to several times, the hierarchy should be dropped after the first reference.

If sites are extremely well known, e.g., Google, AOL, Yahoo!, there is no need to include the hierarchy.

Names of computer programs should be capitalized: Dreamweaver, Adobe Acrobat, Firefox, Flash.

Use **bold** face for computer commands, e.g., “Select **Paste** from the Edit menu” or “**Hold down the alt key** and **press C**.”


###### WORD USAGE (COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS/TERMS)

*a, an*<br>
Use “a” before any word beginning with a consonant sound, even if the word does not begin with a consonant [e.g., a universal theme].

Use “an” before any word beginning with a vowel sound, even if the word does not begin with a vowel [e.g., an honorable defeat].

Also: "The hour-long lecture about the Hubble Space Telescope took place at a historical museum." [not “an historical museum”]

*about, approximately*<br>
As an adverb, “about” means "reasonably close to, almost." “Approximately” means "nearly correct or exact." Use about when possible, though, in scientific contexts, approximately is preferred. Avoid pairing either word with another word of approximation, such as “guess,” “estimate,” or, worst of all, “guesstimate.”

*adequate, sufficient, enough*<br>
Adequate refers to the suitability of something in a particular situation [e.g. an adequate reason for missing work]. Sufficient refers to an amount of material, always with a mass noun [e.g. sufficient food to survive the storm]. Enough modifies both count nouns [e.g. enough people to build the bridge] and mass nouns [e.g. enough water to last the hike].

*affect, effect*<br>
Affect, almost always a verb, means "to influence" [e.g., Jeremy was not affected by peer pressure]. As a noun, it has a specialized psychological definition referring to a perceived emotion [e.g., Jeremy developed a strange affect during the time he spent in London.]

Effect, usually a noun, means "an outcome, result" [e.g., weeks of crash dieting had no effect]. It may also be a verb meaning "to make happen, produce" [e.g., the company’s in-house hypnotist could not effect a submissive state on his subjects].

*afterward, afterword*<br>
Afterward is an adverb that means "later" [e.g., I need to take a nap afterward]. Afterword is a noun that means "an epilogue" [e.g. Did you read the afterword?].

*already, all ready*<br>
Already refers to time [e.g., the show has already started]. All ready refers to preparation [e.g., we are all ready to go to the show].

*altogether, all together*<br>
Altogether means "entirely" [e.g., this party is altogether boring]. All together refers to a unity of time or place [e.g., we were all together at the boring party].

*ambiguous, ambivalent, indifferent*<br>
Ambiguous means "capable of being understood in two or more possible senses or ways" [e.g. the language of the contract was ambiguous]. Someone who is ambivalent has mixed feelings or contradictory ideas [e.g. Carl expressed an ambivalent opinion about the upcoming election] [e.g. her reaction to the film was ambivalent]. Indifferent means having no particular feelings about something [e.g. the storm hadn’t affected her directly, and she felt indifferent to the plight of the victims.]

*among, amongst, between*<br>
Among suggests undefined or collective relationships [e.g. we desired peace among nations] [there was considerable animosity among the team members]. Between suggests a one-to-one relationship [e.g. A certain bond had formed between Derek and Tommy]. Amongst can be used interchangeably with among, although among is more common. Amongst also has a certain old-fashioned flair that you can use to achieve a certain effect.

*biweekly, bimonthly*<br>
See "twice-monthly" below.

*capital, capitol*<br>
A capital is a seat of government (usually a city) [e.g., Sacramento is the capital of California]. A capitol is a building in which a legislature meets [e.g., the legislature began its new session in the capitol]. If you are referring to the building where Congress meets in Washington, DC, it's the "United States Capitol."

*compliment, complement*<br>
A compliment is an expression of esteem, admiration, or respect [e.g., he received many compliments about his new pants]. A complement is something that completes or perfects [e.g. his new pants perfectly complemented his new shirt].

The words can also be used as verbs: to compliment is to praise; to complement is to supplement or complete. If something is complimentary, it is free.

*comprise, compose*<br>
To comprise is to be "made up of, to include" [e.g., the book comprises the chapters]. To compose is "to form the substance of" [e.g. the chapters compose the book]. The phrase "comprised of" is incorrect, though common. Use “composed of” or “consisting of” instead.
discreet, discrete
Discreet means "cautious, judicious" [e.g. a discreet meeting held at midnight]. Discrete means "separate, distinct, unconnected" [e.g. several discrete factors contributed to the accident].

*dual, duel, duet, duo*<br>
Dual refers to two, or consisting of two parts [e.g., a dual-step process]. Duel refers to a combat or conflict between two persons [e.g., they fought in a duel]. It can also be used as a verb [e.g., to duel with one's enemy]. A duet is a composition for two performers [e.g., they performed a duet on guitar and piano]. A duo is a synonym for duet. It can also be used to mean "a pair" [e.g., a brother and sister duo].

*elicit, illicit*<br>
Elicit is a verb that means "to draw out [an answer, information, etc.]" [e.g. he posed that question in order to elicit a particular response]. Illicit is an adjective that means "illegal" [e.g. illicit drugs].

*emcee, MC*<br>
MC is an acceptable abbreviation for emcee and can be used as a verb or noun. [e.g., the MC took the stage] [I was asked to MC the party]

*ensure, insure, assure*<br>
Ensure means "to make certain, sure, or safe; to guarantee" Insure is best used for underwriting financial risk, as in insurance company. "We ensure that we will arrive safely at the Grand Canyon, and insure ourselves in case we don't." We ensure events and insure things. Assure means to convince or inform positively. We assure writers that their style concerns are being addressed.

*eponymous*<br>
The actual meaning of eponymous is "self-titled." An artist or band can have an eponymous album, but the person behind that album is not an eponymous artist. The correct word in that case is "titular."

*etc., and more*<br>
Avoid when possible. Instead, try to rephrase the sentence using the word "including" [e.g. there are films by many Vimeo favorites, including Casey Neistat, DANIELS, and Allison Schulnik].

*farther, further*<br>
Use farther in relation to physical distance [e.g. farther down the street]. Use further in relation to figurative distance [e.g. this project needs further explanation].

*forego, forgo*<br>
To forego is to go before [e.g., the foregoing sentence]. To forgo is to do without, or give up the advantage of [e.g., they decided to forgo the special effects because of monetary concerns].

*irregardless*<br>
Never use this. The correct term is regardless, which we also recommend using sparingly.

*it's, its*<br>  
It's is a contraction for it is; its is the possessive form of it [e.g., It's a shame that its owner keeps it tied to a tree all day].

*lay, lie*<br>
Lay is a transitive verb, which must have a direct object [e.g., he lay the book down]. It is conjugated lay, laid, laid [e.g., he laid the book there this morning] [e.g., the forks have been laid out on the table].

Lie is an intransitive verb, which never takes a direct object [e.g. lie down and rest]. It is conjugated lie, lay, lain [e.g., he lay down to rest] [e.g., he hasn't yet lain down].

*less, fewer*<br>
Use less with mass nouns, or amounts [e.g. less salt, less water, less time]. Use fewer for countable things [e.g. fewer suggestions, fewer people, fewer calories, 10 items or fewer].

*literally*<br>
Literally means "actually; without exaggeration," so don't say that something is "literally as big as a whale" unless you really mean that it is really as big as a whale (a blue whale can be as long as 94 feet). Similarly: "I literally died when she gave me the news." No you didn't, you're still here to tell us about it.

*-long*<br>
For durations shorter than a day, we hyphenate [e.g. minute-long, hour-long]. For durations a day or longer, we do not hyphenate [e.g. daylong, weeklong, monthlong]. However, long durations that are not in common usage [e.g. decade-long, fortnight-long] are hyphenated.

*meringue, merengue*<br>
Meringue is the dessert made with sugar and egg whites. Merengue is a ballroom dance of Haitian and Dominican origin in which one foot is dragged on every step. It is also the music used for the dance. [E.g., after scarfing the meringue, they danced the merengue to burn off some calories.]

*nonprofit*<br>
Normally, you’d want to put a hyphen in this kind of compound noun but in this case, the hyphen is dropped according to A.P. Style.

*OK*
Ok is not okay (nor is it O.K.), OK? (Our favorite way to write this is the latter.)

*since, while*
Since can relate to either time [e.g., I haven’t written a word since last Tuesday] or causation [e.g., since I'm a writer, I know how to use the spell check function], but "because" is preferred in the second case. While can denote either time [e.g., she was cheating on me all the while] or contrast [e.g., while I am not a good singer, I still like to do karaoke], but "although" is preferred in the second case.

*start-ups*
Oftentimes, people drop the hyphen, but we’re following The New York Times’ lead with this one.

such as, like
Avoid using like when indicating a list; use such as instead [e.g., there are many musical styles that annoy me, such as punk, pop-punk, and heavy metal].

tail, tale
A tail is the rear end of an animal, or a location not far behind. [e.g., the dog had a long tail] [e.g., the groupies were on Blake Whitman's tail all night long]. Tail can also be used as a verb to mean "to follow" [e.g., we told the driver to tail the blue sedan].

A tale, always a noun, is a story, usually an imaginative narrative of an event [e.g. he had many tales about Woodstock, the greatest weekend of his life].

that, which
In American prose, that is correctly used to narrow a category or identify a particular item [e.g. I want to find the video that I saw the other day]. Which is used to add something about an item that has already been identified [e.g. I found the video, which, unfortunately, was not as good as I remembered.] Which can be used restrictively only when it follows a preposition [e.g. the car in which we were traveling]. Otherwise it is almost always preceded by a comma, parenthesis, or dash. The distinction between these words is seldom made in British English FYIIIIIII.

time-lapse
Some people write this as one word or as two words, but we’ve done a lot of research and the coolest kids write it as two words with a hyphen in between. So we do too.

toward, towards
Toward is the preferred form in American English; towards is the preferred form in British English. This is also true for other directional words [e.g. backward, downward, forward, upward, and afterward].

twice-monthly, biweekly, bimonthly
When referring to the schedule of something that occurs every other week, always use "twice-monthly." "Bimonthly" and "biweekly" are not to be used, as both have dual meanings that only make for confusion.

who, whom
Who is used when someone is the subject of a finite verb [e.g., the guy who rents a room upstairs] [e.g. who is there?]. Whom is used when someone is the object of verb or preposition [e.g. whom do you wish to see?] [e.g. the guy to whom she rented the room has gone missing] [e.g., to whom can we attribute this amazing style guide?].

you're, your
I can’t believe I’m actually explaining this one, but you're is a contraction of you are [e.g. you're always on time]. Your is the possessive form of you [e.g. your punctuality is an asset].
