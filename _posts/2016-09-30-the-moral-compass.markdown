# Our Moral Compass

You may have noticed: we the humans of Vimeo care a lot about our community members, and everything we build for them. We put our hearts and souls (and even our arms and legs and vertebrae...) into creating the best possible user experience. We also want to spread good vibes across the World Wide Webosphere. In everything we do, we ask ourselves: how will this help our creators and viewers? We also adhere to a core set of values, which act as our True North.

## Our Values

###### Community above all
We’re fueled by an undying love for art, creativity, and above all else, our community of creators and viewers.

###### High quality, but scrappy
We work as a team to build, adapt, and innovate ahead of the industry, without ever sacrificing quality.

###### Passionately diligent
We work hard to find creative solutions and build compelling, best-in-class products that serve and delight our users.

###### Positive vibes
We’re a nice, inclusive, and curious bunch sending only good energy into the world.

###### Dare to be different
We take our work seriously, not ourselves, and aren’t afraid to keep Vimeo weird.
